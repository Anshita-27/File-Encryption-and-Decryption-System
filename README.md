# File-Encryption-and-Decryption-System
<p> This is File Encryption and Decryption System made in Python using Fernet Algorithm </p>
<br>
<p>The Fernet algorithm is a symmetric encryption method that ensures secure message encryption and decryption using AES in CBC mode with a SHA256 HMAC for integrity verification. </p>
<br>
<p>It is part of the cryptography library in Python and provides easy-to-use, authenticated encryption. </p>
